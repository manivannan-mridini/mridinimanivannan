# About Me

Hey there! I'm Mridini, welcome to my portfolio!

I'm a biomedical engineering student who loves building things, breaking them (accidentally), and learning along the way :)) 

This is where I'll be posting the projects I work on — from class assignments to random weekend experiments. I'm especially excited to try out more embedded systems projects, delve into machine learning, and explore the crossover between hardware, code, and biology.

Whether it’s a Python tool, an Arduino prototype, or something totally new, this space is where I’ll be documenting the fun and occasional chaos of figuring things out.☺️
